### Allowed functions:
`ft_putchar`

### Task:
Create a function that displays all different combinations of three different digits in ascending order, listed by ascending order - yes, repetition is voluntary.
Here's the inteded output:
```
$>./a.out | cat -e
012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 023, ..., 789$>
```
987 isn't there because 789 already is.
