## Technical Notes
### Purpose of Creation
The target of this sub-repo is to store compact and easy-understandable solutions to the [School 42's C-'Piscine'](https://www.42.us.org/program/piscine/ "42's US Homepage") (with some meaningful comments).

### Target Audience
Those who want to be prepared, as well as the current students of current 'Piscines'.

### Limitations, Assumptions and Reservations
* All tasks are completed by the repo owner.
* Consequently all logic and structuring, as well as other technical stuff came solely from the owner's head.
* Some tasks, you will see may seem to have ligher / faster / more logical / less sloppy solution? Please feel free to contact or comment!
