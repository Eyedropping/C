## Technical Notes
### Purpose of Creation
The purpose of this directory is to store compact and easy-understandable solutions to the [School 42's 'C-Piscine'](https://www.42.us.org/program/piscine/ "42's US Homepage") (with some meaningful comments).

### Practical NB
I've started the Piscine in Russian [21 School](https://21-school.ru "21's RU Homepage") - the  official "branch" of the 42 School, invested by [PJSC "Sberbank of Russia"](https://www.sberbank.ru/en/). Therefore the program should be identical to original. 

### Target Audience
Those who want to be prepared, as well as the current students of current 'Piscines'.
