## Technical notes:
### Purpose of creation:
The target of this sub-repo is to store compact and easy-understandable solutions to the [School 42's C-'Piscine'](https://www.42.us.org/program/piscine/ "42's US Homepage") (with some meaningful comments).

### Target Audience:
Those who want to be prepared, as well as the current students of the 'Piscine'.

### Limitations, assumptions and reservations
* All tasks are completed by the repo owner.
* Consequently all logic and structuring, as well as other technical stuff came solely from the owner's head.
* Some tasks, you will see may seem to have ligher / faster / more logical / less sloppy solution? Please feel free to contact or comment!
